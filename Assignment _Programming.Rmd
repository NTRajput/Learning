## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

//first we read the program and know about the model 
```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI") 
x <-read.lp("Trucks_1.lp")
x
```
now we get the objective of the model 1 for the trucks problem
```{r}

```

```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective(x)
```
now we look at the constraints the objective is subject to 
```{r}
get.constraints(x)
```
```{r}
t1 <- get.variables(x)
t1
```

```{r}
t1 <- get.variables(x)
s0t1 <- t1[21]
t1 <- t1[-21]
t1m <- matrix(t1,ncol = 4,nrow = 4)
t1mt <- t(t1m)
t1mt <- cbind(c(NA,s0t1,NA,NA),t1mt)
rownames(t1mt) <- c("Purchased","Stock","Small Trucks","Large Trucks")
colnames(t1mt) <- c("0","1","2","3","4")
knitr::kable(t1mt,caption="Transportation by Trucks")
```
```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI") 
y <-read.lp("Hiring.lp")
y
```
```{r}
solve(y)
get.objective(y)
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
get.variables(y)
y
```

```{r}
get.constraints(y)
```
Now, bi = 1 if we hire somebody
```{r} 
library("lpSolveAPI") 
z <-read.lp("Hiring.lp")
z
```
```{r}
solve(z)
get.objective(z)
```

```{r}
get.variables(z)
```
```{r}
v1 <- get.variables(z)
s0 <- v1[19]
v1 <- v1[-19]
tt <- c(NA,NA,s0,NA)
v <- matrix(v1,ncol=4,nrow=6)
v <- t(v)
v <- cbind(tt,v)
rownames(v) <- c("Hired","Fired","Staff","Hired")
colnames(v) <- c("Period 0","Period 1","Period 2","Period 3","Period 4","Period 5","Period 6")
knitr::kable(v,caption = "Optimal Model for Staff Planning")
```
