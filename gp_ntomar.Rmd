####This file contains solutions to a goal programming  problem ,here we try to minimise the three diffrent goals of - Profit , employment level and total Investment captial .

```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
x <- read.lp("gp_ntomar1.lp")
x
```
```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective (x)
```

####we get all the  variabe value now in the objective function and in the constraints
```{r}
get.variables(x)
```
####Note that Y2+ is 8.333, so this solution adds nearly 20% more to the workforce. Consequently, management has concluded that a very high priority should be placed on avoiding an increase in the workforce. Furthermore, management has learned that raising more than $55 million for capital investment for the new products would be extremely difficult, so a very high priority also should be placed on avoiding capital investment above this level.


####In our first goals, we minimize the hiring and capital expenses, with only those constraints.

```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
z <- read.lp("gp_ntomar2.lp")
z
```
```{r}
solve(z)
get.objective(z)
```
####as the solution is zero. So, these goals have now been met, and we can incorporate them as part of the constraints, where y2+ and y3+ are zero.


##Here is the revised model
```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
y <- read.lp("gp_ntomar3.lp")
y
```
```{r}
solve(y)
get.objective(y)
```

```{r}
get.variables(y)
```
####now we try to get the model streamlined by incorporating all goals in one programming also ,introducted M .
```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
z <- read.lp("gp_ntomar4.lp")
z
```
```{r}
solve(z)
get.objective(z)
```
```{r}
get.variables(z)
```
####so in our model as we introduced m we can assign any big no to it however our solution values for variables would not change .
####let see,now M=1000


```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
n <- read.lp("gp_ntomar4.1.lp")
n
```
#### the objective funaction changes but the variable values remain the same.

```{r}
solve(n)
get.objective(n)
```

```{r}
get.variables(n)
```
